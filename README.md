# FiveM React and Lua Boilerplate

This repository is a basic boilerplate for getting started with Angular in NUI. It contains several helpful utilities and was generated with the [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli). The project is set up with SCSS as stylesheet format. It is for both browser and in-game based development workflows.

For in-game workflows, run `ng watch` which will watch the files and build the application upon changes.

This version of the boilerplate is meant for the CfxLua runtime, but should work with other languages if you copy over the `web` folder and the required `fxmanifest.lua` entries.
